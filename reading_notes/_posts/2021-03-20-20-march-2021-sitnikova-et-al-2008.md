<p>An N400-P600 study that looked at real world events. Silent movies containing a context scene and a target scene was used (taking a chopping board and a loaf of bread - cut bread with bread knife (congruous); cut bread with electric iron (incongruous); iron shirt (unrelated)).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a P600 like effect with incongruous vs. congruous, and an anterior N400 like effect with unrelated vs. congruous. What’s the most interesting to me is that the two effects were seemingly dissociable in this study, with incongruous - congruous showing little N400 effects and so on.</p>

<p>The authors discussed their findings under the semantic integration account of the N400, but maybe the newer retrieval account could have allowed them a more simple discussion.</p>
