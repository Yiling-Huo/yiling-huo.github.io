<p>The paper was actually read yesterday, but yesterday I felt there weren’t much to talk about alongside. Today was hospital day, I did my PET scan. Funny enough, I’ve now been inside PET scanners more times than MRI scanners. This was my third PET, and I finally googled the question I’ve always wondered about, why do they ask us to drink milk before the scan? I first searched in English and found nothing, then Japanese and also nothing. I finally googled in Chinese (sorry GFW), and found the disappointing answer that they just needed something inside our stomach to get a better stomach image. It actually didn’t matter at all whether it’s milk or water or anything. It feels funny now thinking about how my mom always put so much effort to make me fresh sugar free soy milk the night before, because of my lactose intolerance . I guess the reason why I found nothing in the first two searches was other countries may not specify the milk part. I also guess the reason why we especially asked patients to drink milk instead of any other liquid is that milk is probably one of the least likely drinks to contain sugar? During my search I found images explaining how blood sugar level massively affects PET scan quality, which is very interesting.</p>

<p>Back to the paper. This is a very familiar predictability N400 study. Every single thing is done the typical N400 way, cloze task, high predictably vs. low vs. anomalous, 8 electrodes, ISI 350, etc., except that the authors used comics instead of sentences to test non verbal prediction effects.</p>

<p>The results are typically N400, too. The anomalous pictures evokes a higher amplitude N400, 400-800ms fronto-central. They also found the N400 to be more negative 500-600ms in low cloze vs. high cloze central, although the effect was tiny. They also correlated cloze probability with N400 amplitude, and found significances.</p>

<p>The authors also noted that the N400 in this study is slightly later than typical, which they attributed to the visual complexity of comic images. In sum, they concluded that the N400 component is sensor to visual narrative they same way it is to linguistic narrative. </p>
