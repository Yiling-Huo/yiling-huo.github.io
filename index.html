    <p>Having started my PhD journey at UCL, the world of research feels both exciting and new. While these pages might seem a bit sparse for now, I'm dedicated to filling them with my work!</p>
    <p>My journey to research is only possible with the support of my dear family, my friends, and my very supportive supervisors.</p>
    <p>I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics/linguistics-people" target="_blank">UCL Linguistics</a>. I work with my supervisor <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/wingyee-chow" target="_blank">Dr. Wing-Yee Chow</a> on prediction during language comprehension. My research delves into the role of phonological information in sentence-level prediction, as well as what factors may enhance or inhibit prediction during language comprehension.</p>
    <p>Aside from my passion for research and teaching, I find joy in hobbies like video games, cooking, and traveling.</p>
    <p>You can explore some of my workflow and scripts on my <a href="https://yiling-huo.github.io/tutorials/" target="_blank">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://yiling-huo.github.io/resources/" target="_blank">resources</a> pages.</p>
