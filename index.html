    <p>Currently pursuing a PhD in Psycholinguistics at UCL, I'm honing my skills to transform research and data into impactful insights. I am a skilled researcher, data scientist, and scientific communicator. </p>
    <p>My journey is only possible with the support of my dear family, my friends, and my very supportive supervisors.</p>
    <p>I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics/linguistics-people" target="_blank">UCL Linguistics</a>. I work with my supervisor <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/wingyee-chow" target="_blank">Dr. Wing-Yee Chow</a> on prediction during language comprehension. My research delves into the role of phonological information in lexical prediction, as well as what factors may enhance or inhibit prediction during language comprehension.</p>
    <p>Aside from my passion for research and teaching, I find joy in hobbies like photography, video games, cooking, and traveling.</p>
