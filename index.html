    <p>Exciting news - I've successfully defended my viva recently at UCL! </p>
    <p>As I approached my PhD in Psycholinguistics, I keep honing my skills to transform research and data into impactful insights. I am a skilled researcher, data scientist, and scientific communicator. </p>
    <p>My journey is only possible with the support of my dear family, my friends, and colleagues.</p>
    <p>My research delves into the role of phonological information in lexical prediction, as well as what factors enhance or inhibit prediction during language comprehension.</p>
    <p>Aside from my passion for research and teaching, I find joy in hobbies like photography, video games, cooking, and travelling.</p>
