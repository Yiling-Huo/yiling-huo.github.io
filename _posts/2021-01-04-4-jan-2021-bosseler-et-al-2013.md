<p>A MEG study that aims to test whether theta brain oscillation (previously shown to indicate attention) can reflect perceptual narrowing of speech. Three groups, 6-months, 12-months, and adults, participated the odd-ball paradigm study. Relative theta power was recorded in conditions varying in Frequency (frequently presented syllable vs. infrequent) and language (native vs. non-native). The authors hypothesized that 6-month-olds would show more RTP for Frequent vs. Infrequent, adult would show more RTP for Non-native vs. Native, while 12-months-olds would show transitional pattern closer to adults.</p>

<p>All three predictions were confirmed by statistics. There was a significant interaction of age x frequency, with only 6-months-olds showing significantly more RTP for frequent vs. infrequent; there was also an interaction of age x language, with with effects of language in adults and 12-months-olds.</p>

<p>The authors concluded that the theta brain oscillation indexes an implicit learning process that entails a shift of attention to speech stimuli.</p>
