<p>A Japanese study I bumped into when reading Kutas Ferdemeier 2011. The study is about Japanese calssifiers and the N400. A simple N400 study comparing congrugent and incongrugent classifiers appearing before a noun. They had similar results as Kwon et al 2017 on Chinese classifier, but they only had correct vs. incorrect, while Kwon also had a 'correct but unusual' condition. Unfortunately, this study gave an odd task to the participants: to make dicisions on whether the classifier in the sentence is compatible with the noun, which is a task that explicitly directed the participant's attention to the target. Their results showed very large N400 effects, which the authors attributed to some other random factors but I think the too-obvious N400 is all about the explicit task.</p>
