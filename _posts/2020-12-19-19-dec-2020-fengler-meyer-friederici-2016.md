<p>An fMRI study from Max Planck looking at developmental attunement of the brain (PO &amp; IPL/pSTG) to functional selective language processing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3 age groups were tested: 5-6 years, 7-8 years, and adults, using sentences with no embedded clause (baseline), one embedded clause (simple syntax), and two embedded clauses (complex syntax) (the complex syntax was so complex that I read the example 10 times and still didn’t understand the meaning. But hey, it’s German). Task was to find the correct picture from two pictures that represents the sentence.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the results are as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behaviorally, only 5-6 years showed different reaction time for simple vs. complex.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whole brain, interaction of complexity x age in left PO, left IPL to pSTG, bilateral cerebellum, and supplementary motor area. (I later discovered that they meant bilateral cerebellum AND BILATERAL supplementary motor.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ROIs were mainly left Pars Opercularis, left IPL/pSTG (word “left” omitted below). Brain functional complexity score (selectivity) increased with age (but not between two children groups) for all ROIs and SMA and cerebellum. Gray matter probability decreased with age (also not between children) in PO and IPL/pSTG. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accuracy negatively associated with activation in the ROIs. Brain functional complexity scores correlated with digit span, representing positive correlation if sun too la selectivity with visual working memory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regressions. Structure coefficients are used (correlations coefficients not influenced by other predictors (?)). GMP and digit span explained most variance in Brain functional complexity score in both ROIs. Commonality analysis, brain functional complexity score best explained by shared variance of age and GMP; age, GMP, and digit span; age and digit span in IPL/pSTG. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Group specific regressions. In 5-6 years, activation difference in PO between complex and simple predicted by activation in the SMA. In 7-8 years predicted partially by SMA. In adults, fully predicted by IPL/pSTG. (Stepwise attunement).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The authors discussed the results as finding a well-described network in left hemisphere for adults, and a functional attunement toward adult-like selectivity for complex sentences across development. In PO, only adults show selectivity, and establishment of adult like selectivity is predicted by PO’s GMP across age groups. GMP reduction in left IPL/pSTG is also associated with attunement toward adult activity patterns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The authors concluded that structural brain maturation and visual working memory expansion provide basis for functional selectivity in language areas.</p>
